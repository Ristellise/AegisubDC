# Aegisub

For binaries and general information [see the homepage](http://www.aegisub.org).

The bug tracker can be found at https://github.com/Aegisub/Aegisub/issues .

Support is available on IRC ( irc://irc.rizon.net/aegisub ).

## Building Aegisub

### autoconf / make (for linux and macOS)

This is the recommended way of building Aegisub on linux and macOS. Currently AviSynth+ support is not included in autoconf project. If you need AviSynth+ support, see CMake instructions below.

Aegisub has some required dependencies:
* `libass`
* `Boost`(with ICU support)
* `OpenGL`
* `libicu`
* `wxWidgets`
* `zlib`
* `fontconfig` (not needed on Windows)
* `luajit` (or `lua`)

and optional dependencies:
* `ALSA`
* `FFMS2`
* `FFTW`
* `Hunspell`
* `OpenAL`
* `uchardet`
* `AviSynth+`

You can use the package manager provided by your distro to install these dependencies. Package name varies by distro. Some useful references are:

* For ArchLinux, refer to [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=aegisub-git).
* For Ubuntu, refer to [Travis](https://github.com/wangqr/Aegisub/blob/dev/.travis.yml#L14-L35).
* For macOS, see [Special notice for macOS](https://github.com/wangqr/Aegisub/wiki/Special-notice-for-macOS) on project Wiki.

After installing the dependencies, you can clone and build Aegisub with:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/wangqr/Aegisub.git
cd Aegisub
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
```

### CMake (for Windows and linux)

This fork also provides CMake build. The CMake project will only build Aegisub itself, without the translation.

You still need to install the dependencies above. To enable AviSynth+ support, it is also needed. On ArchLinux this can be done by installing [avisynthplus-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/avisynthplus-git). Installing dependencies on Windows can be tricky, as Windows doesn't have a good package manager. Refer to [the Wiki page](https://github.com/wangqr/Aegisub/wiki/Compile-guide-for-Windows-(CMake,-MSVC)) on how to get all dependencies on Windows.

After installing the dependencies, you can clone and build Aegisub with:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wangqr/Aegisub.git
cd Aegisub
./build/version.sh .  # This will generate build/git_version.h
mkdir build-dir
cd build-dir
cmake ..  # Or use cmake-gui / ccmake
make
```

Features can be turned on/off in CMake by toggling the `WITH_*` switches.

## Updating Moonscript

From within the Moonscript repository, run `bin/moon bin/splat.moon -l moonscript moonscript/ > bin/moonscript.lua`.
Open the newly created `bin/moonscript.lua`, and within it make the following changes:

1. Prepend the final line of the file, `package.preload["moonscript"]()`, with a `return`, producing `return package.preload["moonscript"]()`.
2. Within the function at `package.preload['moonscript.base']`, remove references to `moon_loader`, `insert_loader`, and `remove_loader`. This means removing their declarations, definitions, and entries in the returned table.
3. Within the function at `package.preload['moonscript']`, remove the line `_with_0.insert_loader()`.

The file is now ready for use, to be placed in `automation/include` within the Aegisub repo.
