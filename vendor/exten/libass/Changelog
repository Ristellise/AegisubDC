libass (unreleased)

 * Switch from Yasm to NASM for building hand-written assembler code
 * Support Core Text font provider on Mac OS X 10.6 and 10.7
 * Clear font cache in ass_set_fonts(). This fixes potentially incorrect
   font choices and an occasional crash if this function is called midway
   through rendering a file.

libass (0.13.7)
 * Fix invalid memory accesses with BorderStyle=4
 * Fix change detection bug on frame resizes
 * Fix cache bugs with border size
 * Reduce precision of border width in font outline caching

 * Allow using shadow offset to adjust size of background with BorderStyle=4
 * Fix TrueType/OpenType font collection handling with the DirectWrite backend

libass (0.13.6)
 * Bump ABI version to account for the new Justify field in ASS_Style
   that was added in 0.13.5.

libass (0.13.5)
 * Add Justify style override that changes text justification
   (left/right/center) without affecting event positioning.
 * Fix ass_set_cache_limits() to affect total bitmap cache size
   including composite bitmap cache.
 * Number parsing fixes
   * Fix illegal read when parsing some numbers in scientific notation
     with huge exponents.
   * Correctly evaluate numbers in scientific notation with large exponents.
   * Correctly evaluate numbers with many leading zeros.
 * Bug fixes found with fuzzing
   * Fix a small memory leak in the parser.
   * Fix illegal read in the parser on specially crafted input with \t tags.

libass (0.13.4)
 * Bug fixes found with fuzzing
   * Fix memory reallocation in the shaper. (CVE-2016-7972)
   * Fix two small memory leaks in the parser and test program.
   * Fix illegal read in Gaussian blur coefficient calculations.
     (CVE-2016-7970)
   * Fix mode 0/3 line wrapping equalization in specific cases which could
     result in illegal reads while laying out and shaping text.
     (CVE-2016-7969)

libass (0.13.3)
 * Improve compatibility/portablility of build system,
   should fix e.g. compilation on Solaris.
 * Fix memory leak in DirectWrite font provider.
 * Fix the rasterizer when rendering some large outlines.
 * Remove hack that forced RTL base direction depending on font encoding.
 * Greatly improve the internal caches with refcounting and gradual clearing.

libass (0.13.2)
 * Add ass_set_check_readorder() API function to disable use of the ReadOrder
   field for duplicate checking in ass_process_chunk().
 * ass_step_sub(track, now, 0) now finds the start of the subtitle at "now".
 * Bug fixes
   * Fix an issue with the new duplicate checking, which could lead to
     missing subtitles after seeking.
   * Fix a crash with CoreText under specific circumstances

libass (0.13.1)
 * Much faster duplicate event check in ass_process_chunk. This can
   bring a large speedup for embedded subtitles with lots of events.
   To make this possible, it is now forbidden to combine calls to
   ass_process_chunk with any other method of manipulating the event
   list, namely, manual manipulation and calls to ass_process_data,
   ass_read_memory and ass_read_file.
 * Interpret negative timestamp components as actual negative numbers.
   This change increases compatibility with VSFilter.
 * Font matching changes for VSFilter compatibility
   * Look up fonts that contain PostScript outlines by their PostScript
     name instead of their full names. Family names continue to be used
     for all fonts.
   * Keep spaces in font names
 * Drop support for Fontconfig < 2.10.92 to ensure correct font matching
 * Bug fixes
   * Fix building the assembler code for the x32 ABI (GH #200)
   * Fix static linking against libass through pkg-config when libass
     uses libiconv
   * Fix some small memory leaks, potential crashes and bad data uses

libass (0.13.0)
 * Add native font selection backends for OSX (CoreText) and Windows
   (DirectWrite). You can now run libass without fontconfig on these
   platforms. This fixes problems with fontconfig behaving badly on
   these platforms (it could take minutes to scan all system fonts).
   Even on Linux, this speeds up loading of embedded fonts (such as
   provided by ass_add_font()).
   The DirectWrite backend only works on Windows Vista and later. On
   XP, fontconfig is still needed. libass can be compiled with both
   DirectWrite and fontconfig, and then it will fallback to fontconfig
   automatically if DirectWrite is not available at runtime.
 * Add ass_get_available_font_providers() API function.
 * Change the 4th parameter of ass_set_fonts(). This now selects the
   font provider. This is somewhat backwards compatible with the old
   behavior, but if you ever passed values other than 0 or 1, your
   application might break with this libass release.
 * The ass_fonts_update() function now does nothing. It's kept for
   backward compatibility only.
 * Much faster gaussian blur. This can bring a large speedup with big
   blurred signs and such.
 * Drop ENCA support
 * Bug fixes
   * Fix compilation of the freetype rasterizer (disabled by default)
   * Fix rendering with some cases of consecutive line breaks (\N\N).

     C functions
