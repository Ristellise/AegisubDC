<p>
      In text shaping, a <span class="emphasis"><em>cluster</em></span> is a sequence of
      characters that needs to be treated as a single, indivisible
      unit. A single letter or symbol can be a cluster of its
      own. Other clusters correspond to longer subsequences of the
      input code points — such as a ligature or conjunct form
      — and require the shaper to ensure that the cluster is not
      broken during the shaping process.
    </p>
<p>
      A cluster is distinct from a <span class="emphasis"><em>grapheme</em></span>,
      which is the smallest unit of meaning in a writing system or
      script.
    </p>
<p>
      The definitions of the two terms are similar. However, clusters
      are only relevant for script shaping and glyph layout. In
      contrast, graphemes are a property of the underlying script, and
      are of interest when client programs implement orthographic 
      or linguistic functionality.
    </p>
<p>
      For example, two individual letters are often two separate
      graphemes. When two letters form a ligature, however, they
      combine into a single glyph. They are then part of the same
      cluster and are treated as a unit by the shaping engine —
      even though the two original, underlying letters remain separate
      graphemes.
    </p>
<p>
      HarfBuzz is concerned with clusters, <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
      with graphemes — although client programs using HarfBuzz
      may still care about graphemes for other reasons from time to time.
    </p>
<p>
      During the shaping process, there are several shaping operations
      that may merge adjacent characters (for example, when two code
      points form a ligature or a conjunct form and are replaced by a
      single glyph) or split one character into several (for example,
      when decomposing a code point through the
      <code class="literal">ccmp</code> feature). Operations like these alter
      clusters; HarfBuzz tracks the changes to ensure that no clusters
      get lost or broken during shaping. 
    </p>
<p>
      HarfBuzz records cluster information independently from how
      shaping operations affect the individual glyphs returned in an
      output buffer. Consequently, a client program using HarfBuzz can
      utilize the cluster information to implement features such as:
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem"><p>

	  decomposed, reordered, or undergone other shaping operations.
