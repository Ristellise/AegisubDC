<p>
      Shaping a complex-script text run involves transforming the
      input sequence of Unicode codepoints with some combination of
      operations that is specified in the shaping model for the
      script.
    </p>
<p>
      The specific conditions that trigger a given operation for a
      text run varies from script to script, as do the order that the
      operations are performed in and which codepoints are
      affected. However, the same general set of shaping operations is
      common to all of the complex-script shaping models.

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
<p>
	  A <span class="emphasis"><em>reordering</em></span> operation moves a glyph
	  from its original ("logical") position in the sequence to
	  some other ("visual") position.
	</p>
<p>
	  The shaping model for a given complex script might involve
	  more than one reordering step.
	</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
	  A <span class="emphasis"><em>joining</em></span> operation replaces a glyph
	  with an alternate form that is designed to connect with one
	  or more of the adjacent glyphs in the sequence.
	</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>
	  A contextual <span class="emphasis"><em>substitution</em></span> operation
	  replaces either a single glyph or a subsequence of several
	  glyphs with an alternate glyph. This substitution is
	  performed when the original glyph or subsequence of glyphs
	  occurs in a specified position with respect to the
	  surrounding sequence. For example, one substitution might be
	  performed only when the target glyph is the first glyph in
	  the sequence, while another substitution is performed only
	  when a different target glyph occurs immediately after a
	  particular string pattern.
	</p>
<p>
	  The shaping model for a given complex script might involve
	  multiple contextual-substitution operations, each applying
	  to different target glyphs and patterns, and which are
	  performed in separate steps.
	</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>
	  A contextual <span class="emphasis"><em>positioning</em></span> operation
	  moves the horizontal and/or vertical position of a
	  glyph. This positioning move is performed when the glyph
	  occurs in a specified position with respect to the
	  surrounding sequence.
	</p>
<p>
	  Many contextual positioning operations are used to place
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>mark</em></span> glyphs (such as diacritics, vowel
	  signs, and tone markers) with respect to
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>base</em></span> glyphs. However, some complex
	  scripts may use contextual positioning operations to
	  correctly place base glyphs as well, such as
	  when the script uses <span class="emphasis"><em>stacking</em></span> characters.
