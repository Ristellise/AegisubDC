      In the previous chapter, we saw how to set up a buffer and fill
      it with text as Unicode code points. In order to shape this
      buffer text with HarfBuzz, you will need also need a font
      object.
    </p>
<p>
      HarfBuzz provides abstractions to help you cache and reuse the
      heavier parts of working with binary fonts, so we will look at
      how to do that. We will also look at how to work with the
      FreeType font-rendering library and at how you can customize
      HarfBuzz to work with other libraries.
    </p>
<p>
      Finally, we will look at how to work with OpenType variable
      fonts, the latest update to the OpenType font format, and at
      some other recent additions to OpenType.
    </p>

<p>
      The outcome of shaping a run of text depends on the contents of
      a specific font file (such as the substitutions and positioning
      moves in the 'GSUB' and 'GPOS' tables), so HarfBuzz makes
      accessing those internals fast.
    </p>
<p>
      An <span class="type">hb_face_t</span> represents a <span class="emphasis"><em>face</em></span>
      in HarfBuzz. This data type is a wrapper around an
      <span class="type">hb_blob_t</span> blob that holds the contents of a binary
      font file. Since HarfBuzz supports TrueType Collections and
      OpenType Collections (each of which can include multiple
      typefaces), a HarfBuzz face also requires an index number
      specifying which typeface in the file you want to use. Most of
      the font files you will encounter in the wild include just a
      single face, however, so most of the time you would pass in
      <code class="literal">0</code> as the index when you create a face:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      hb_blob_t* blob = hb_blob_create_from_file(file);
      ...
      hb_face_t* face = hb_face_create(blob, 0);
    </pre>
<p>
      On its own, a face object is not quite ready to use for
      shaping. The typeface must be set to a specific point size in
      order for some details (such as hinting) to work. In addition,
      if the font file in question is an OpenType Variable Font, then
      you may need to specify one or variation-axis settings (or a
      named instance) in order to get the output you need.
    </p>
<p>
      In HarfBuzz, you do this by creating a <span class="emphasis"><em>font</em></span>
      object from your face.
    </p>
<p>
      Font objects also have the advantage of being considerably
      lighter-weight than face objects (remember that a face contains
      the contents of a binary font file mapped into memory). As a
      result, you can cache and reuse a font object, but you could
      also create a new one for each additional size you needed.
      Creating new fonts incurs some additional overhead, of course,
      but whether or not it is excessive is your call in the end. In
      contrast, face objects are substantially larger, and you really
      should cache them and reuse them whenever possible.
    </p>
<p>
      You can create a font object from a face object:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      hb_font_t* hb_font = hb_font_create(hb_face);
    </pre>
<p>
      After creating a font, there are a few properties you should
      set. Many fonts enable and disable hints based on the size it
      is used at, so setting this is important for font
      objects. <code class="function">hb_font_set_ppem(font, x_ppem,
      y_ppem)</code> sets the pixels-per-EM value of the font. You
      can also set the point size of the font with
      <code class="function">hb_font_set_ptem(font, ptem)</code>. HarfBuzz uses the
      industry standard 72 points per inch.
    </p>
<p>
      HarfBuzz lets you specify the degree subpixel precision you want
      through a scaling factor. You can set horizontal and
      vertical scaling factors on the
      font by calling <code class="function">hb_font_set_scale(font, x_scale,
      y_scale)</code>. 
    </p>
<p>
      There may be times when you are handed a font object and need to
      access the face object that it comes from. For that, you can call
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      hb_face = hb_font_get_face(hb_font);
    </pre>
<p>
      You can also create a font object from an existing font object
      using the <code class="function">hb_font_create_sub_font()</code>
      function. This creates a child font object that is initiated
      with the same attributes as its parent; it can be used to
      quickly set up a new font for the purpose of overriding a specific
      font-functions method.
    </p>
<p>
      All face objects and font objects are lifecycle-managed by
      HarfBuzz. After creating a face, you increase its reference
      count with <code class="function">hb_face_reference(face)</code> and
      decrease it with
      <code class="function">hb_face_destroy(face)</code>. Likewise, you
      increase the reference count on a font with
      <code class="function">hb_font_reference(font)</code> and decrease it
      with <code class="function">hb_font_destroy(font)</code>.
    </p>
<p>
      You can also attach user data to face objects and font objects.
