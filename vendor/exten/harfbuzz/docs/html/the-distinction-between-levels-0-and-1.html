<p>
      The preceding examples demonstrate the main effects of using
      cluster levels 0 and 1. The only difference between the two
      levels is this: in level 0, at the very beginning of the shaping
      process, HarfBuzz merges the cluster of each base character
      with the clusters of all Unicode marks (combining or not) and
      modifiers that follow it.
    </p>
<p>
      For example, let us start with the following character sequence
      (top row) and accompanying initial cluster values (bottom row):
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      A,acute,B
      0,1    ,2
    </pre>
<p>
      The <code class="literal">acute</code> is a Unicode mark. If HarfBuzz is
      using cluster level 0 on this sequence, then the
      <code class="literal">A</code> and <code class="literal">acute</code> clusters will
      merge, and the result will become:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      A,acute,B
      0,0    ,2
    </pre>
<p>
      This merger is performed before any other script-shaping
      steps.
    </p>
<p>
      This initial cluster merging is the default behavior of the
      Windows shaping engine, and the old HarfBuzz codebase copied
      that behavior to maintain compatibility. Consequently, it has
      remained the default behavior in the new HarfBuzz codebase.
    </p>
<p>
      But this initial cluster-merging behavior makes it impossible
      for client programs to implement some features (such as to
      color diacritic marks differently from their base
      characters). That is why, in level 1, HarfBuzz does not perform
      the initial merging step.
    </p>
<p>
      For client programs that rely on HarfBuzz cluster values to
      perform cursor positioning, level 0 is more convenient. But
      relying on cluster boundaries for cursor positioning is wrong: cursor
      positions should be determined based on Unicode grapheme
      boundaries, not on shaping-cluster boundaries. As such, using
      level 1 clustering behavior is recommended. 
    </p>
<p>
      One final facet of levels 0 and 1 is worth noting. HarfBuzz
      currently does not allow any
      <span class="emphasis"><em>multiple-substitution</em></span> GSUB lookups to 
      replace a glyph with zero glyphs (in other words, to delete a
      glyph).
    </p>
<p>
      But, in some other situations, glyphs can be deleted. In
      those cases, if the glyph being deleted is the last glyph of its
      cluster, HarfBuzz makes sure to merge the deleted glyph's
      cluster with a neighboring cluster.
    </p>
<p>
      This is done primarily to make sure that the starting cluster of the
      text always has the cluster index pointing to the start of the text
      for the run; more than one client program currently relies on this
      guarantee.
    </p>
<p>
      Incidentally, Apple's CoreText does something different to
      maintain the same promise: it inserts a glyph with id 65535 at
      the beginning of the glyph string if the glyph corresponding to
      the first character in the run was deleted. HarfBuzz might do
      something similar in the future.
