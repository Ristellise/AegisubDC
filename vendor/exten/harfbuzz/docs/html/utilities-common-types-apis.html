<p>
      HarfBuzz includes several APIs for working with general-purpose
      data that you may find convenient to leverage in your own
      software. They include set operations and integer-to-integer
      mapping operations.
    </p>
<p>
      HarfBuzz uses set operations for internal bookkeeping, such as
      when it collects all of the glyph IDs covered by a particular
      font feature. You can also use the set API to build sets, add
      and remove elements, test whether or not sets contain particular
      elements, or compute the unions, intersections, or differences
      between sets.
    </p>
<p>
      All set elements are integers (specifically,
      <span class="type">hb_codepoint_t</span> 32-bit unsigned ints), and there are
      functions for fetching the minimum and maximum element from a
      set. The set API also includes some functions that might not 
      be part of a generic set facility, such as the ability to add a
      contiguous range of integer elements to a set in bulk, and the
      ability to fetch the next-smallest or next-largest element.
    </p>
<p>
      The HarfBuzz set API includes some conveniences as well. All
      sets are lifecycle-managed, just like other HarfBuzz
      objects. You increase the reference count on a set with
      <code class="function">hb_set_reference()</code> and decrease it with
      <code class="function">hb_set_destroy()</code>. You can also attach
      user data to a set, just like you can to blobs, buffers, faces,
      fonts, and other objects, and set destroy callbacks.
    </p>
<p>
      HarfBuzz also provides an API for keeping track of
      integer-to-integer mappings. As with the set API, each integer is
      stored as an unsigned 32-bit <span class="type">hb_codepoint_t</span>
      element. Maps, like other objects, are reference counted with
      reference and destroy functions, and you can attach user data to
      them. The mapping operations include adding and deleting
      integer-to-integer key:value pairs to the map, testing for the
      presence of a key, fetching the population of the map, and so on.
    </p>
<p>
      There are several other internal HarfBuzz facilities that are
      exposed publicly and which you may want to take advantage of
      while processing text. HarfBuzz uses a common
      <span class="type">hb_tag_t</span> for a variety of OpenType tag identifiers (for
      scripts, languages, font features, table names, variation-axis
      names, and more), and provides functions for converting strings
      to tags and vice-versa. 
    </p>
<p>
      Finally, HarfBuzz also includes data type for Booleans, bit
      masks, and other simple types.
