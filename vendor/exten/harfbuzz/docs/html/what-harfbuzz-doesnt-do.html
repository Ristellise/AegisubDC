<p>
      HarfBuzz will take a Unicode string, shape it, and give you the
      information required to lay it out correctly on a single
      horizontal (or vertical) line using the font provided. That is the
      extent of HarfBuzz's responsibility.
    </p>
<p>
      It is important to note that if you are implementing a complete
      text-layout engine you may have other responsibilities that
      HarfBuzz will <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> help you with. For example:
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
<p>
          HarfBuzz won't help you with bidirectionality. If you want to
          lay out text that includes a mix of Hebrew and English, you
	  will need to ensure that each buffer provided to HarfBuzz
	  has all of its characters in the same order and that the
	  directionality of the buffer is set correctly. This may mean
	  segmenting the text before it is placed into HarfBuzz buffers. In
          other words, the user will hit the keys in the following
          sequence:
        </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
	  A B C [space] ג ב א [space] D E F
        </pre>
<p>
          but will expect to see in the output:
        </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
	  ABC אבג DEF
        </pre>
<p>
          This reordering is called <span class="emphasis"><em>bidi processing</em></span>
          ("bidi" is short for bidirectional), and there's an
          algorithm as an annex to the Unicode Standard which tells you how
          to process a string of mixed directionality.
          Before sending your string to HarfBuzz, you may need to apply the
          bidi algorithm to it. Libraries such as <a class="ulink" href="http://icu-project.org/" target="_top">ICU</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://fribidi.org/" target="_top">fribidi</a> can do this for you.
        </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>
          HarfBuzz won't help you with text that contains different font
          properties. For instance, if you have the string "a
          <span class="emphasis"><em>huge</em></span> breakfast", and you expect
          "huge" to be italic, then you will need to send three
          strings to HarfBuzz: <code class="literal">a</code>, in your Roman font;
          <code class="literal">huge</code> using your italic font; and
          <code class="literal">breakfast</code> using your Roman font again.
	</p>
<p>
          Similarly, if you change the font, font size, script,
	  language, or direction within your string, then you will
	  need to shape each run independently and output them
	  independently. HarfBuzz expects to shape a run of characters
	  that all share the same properties.
        </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>
          HarfBuzz won't help you with line breaking, hyphenation, or
          justification. As mentioned above, HarfBuzz lays out the string
          along a <span class="emphasis"><em>single line</em></span> of, notionally,
          infinite length. If you want to find out where the potential
          word, sentence and line break points are in your text, you
          could use the ICU library's break iterator functions.
        </p>
<p>
          HarfBuzz can tell you how wide a shaped piece of text is, which is
          useful input to a justification algorithm, but it knows nothing
          about paragraphs, lines or line lengths. Nor will it adjust the
          space between words to fit them proportionally into a line.
        </p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>
      As a layout-engine implementor, HarfBuzz will help you with the
      interface between your text and your font, and that's something
      that you'll need—what you then do with the glyphs that your font
      returns is up to you.
