# Building uchardet (generic)

`uchardet` uses a typical cmake installation.

* Configure with `cmake`. There are various options. For instance to configure
  with a prefix as a release-ready build:

> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/jehan/.local -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

Alternatively, use `ccmake`, curses interface to `cmake`.

* Build with `make`.

* Install with `make install`.

Read `README` for more details on uchardet.

# Building uchardet on Windows

The above procedure is generic, which means it should work on any platform.
In particular, it works well on Linux.

The procedure is the same on Windows, but if you want more details (for
instance which tools to use in order to run CMake on Windows, compiler
information, etc.), the following link may be useful:
