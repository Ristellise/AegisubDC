Behdad Esfahbod <behdad@gnu.org>
#
# Behdad Esfahbod maintained the entire 0.19 series. He designed, and
# implemented most of what is in FriBidi today.

Dov Grobgeld <dov.grobgeld@gmail.com>
#
# Dov Grobgeld originally wrote FriBidi.  The 0.1.* releases were all done
# by him.  After the a long time of not being involved, Dov received
# back the maintenance of the package in time for the 1.0 release.
# He did the entire algorithmic work to support the changes made
# to the Unicode algorithm in the Unicode 6.3 standard.
#

Roozbeh Pournader <roozbeh@gnu.org>
#
# Roozbeh Pournader hasn't contributed much code to FriBidi personally; but
# has maintained, promoted, and supported the project for a while.  He has
# helped with making GNU FriBidi standards compliant, and has sometimes
# lobbied with the Unicode Consortium when needed.  Roozbeh was supposed to
# be a co-maintainer of GNU FriBidi, but he's not doing that yet.
#

Khaled Hosny <khaledhosny@eglug.org>
#
# Khaled Hosny has done lots of cleanup and autoconfig work.

# Note: Other people have contributed significant amounts of code, but
# usually the code has faded out because of restructuring and redesigning
# things around GNU FriBidi.  As an example, the FriBidiEnv patch by Omer
# Zak, made itself into FriBidi CVS for a couple of years, but was finally
# implemented in a better way by Behdad.
#
# Note: GNU getopt is distributed with and used in GNU FriBidi under bin/, but
# is not part of GNU FriBidi.
#
# Note: Parts of the Unicode Character Database are distributed with and used
# in GNU FriBidi under gen.tab/unidata/, but are not part of GNU FriBidi.
