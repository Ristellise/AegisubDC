Instructions on running the benchmark
=====================================

This benchmark can be run in two modes, either as a program linked against
libluajit.a or by running the scripts with an external lua command.  The
results of both modes are similar but not comparable due to the difference in
precision of timings in both cases.  In both cases, higher number is better and
the output is in the following format:

  <benchmark name>:<total executions>:<executions per second>

Benchmark binary
----------------

Invoke the benchmark by simply running the `make bench` command from the top
level or by entering the `bench` directory and running the `make` command.

You can change the benchmark duration using the BENCH_DURATION variable like
so:

    make BENCH_DURATION=20 bench

Benchmarking an external lua command
------------------------------------

Invoke the benchmark as follows from within the bench directory.  Add a 'bench'
target if you're running the command from the top level:

    make LUA_BIN={{Your lua/luajit bin}}

LIMITATION
----------

Benchmarking using an external lua command currently has very low resolution
timing (milliseconds) compared to the binary, which uses clock_gettime and
hence has nanosecond resolution.  As a result, one cannot reasonably compare
results using the benchmark binary with that of the script.
